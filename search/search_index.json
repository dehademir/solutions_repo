Motivation Escape velocity is the minimum speed an object needs to break free from a celestial body's gravitational pull without further propulsion. This concept is essential in space exploration for launching rockets, satellites, and interplanetary missions . In addition to escape velocity, the first, second, and third cosmic velocities define the speeds required for: 1. Stable orbits (first cosmic velocity) 2. Escaping a planet (second cosmic velocity) 3. Escaping a star system (third cosmic velocity) These principles are key for missions such as: - Artificial satellites (first cosmic velocity) - Lunar and Mars missions (second cosmic velocity) - Interstellar exploration (third cosmic velocity) 2.
