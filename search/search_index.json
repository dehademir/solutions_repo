Introduction and Motivation Projectile motion is one of the most fundamental topics in mechanics, with applications in sports, ballistics, space exploration, and engineering. Understanding how the range of a projectile varies with its launch angle is crucial in many real-world scenarios: Sports Science : Optimizing a soccer player's free-kick or a basketball shot. Military and Ballistics : Calculating the range of a projectile in different terrains. Space Science : Predicting the trajectory of spacecraft launched from different planets. Engineering : Designing water fountains or roller coasters with precise parabolic arcs. In this study, we investigate how the range of a projectile depends on the launch angle and explore factors that influence projectile motion. 2. Theoretical Foundation Newton\u2019s Second Law Newton\u2019s second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration: \\[ \\vec{F} = m \\vec{a} \\] For a projectile in free fall under Earth's gravitational field, the only force acting on it is gravity: \\[ \\vec{F} = -mg \\hat{j} \\] Since acceleration is the second derivative of position with respect to time, Newton\u2019s second law can be written as: \\[ m \\frac{d^2 \\vec{r}}{dt^2} = -mg \\hat{j} \\] Dividing by mass: \\[ \\frac{d^2 \\vec{r}}{dt^2} = -g \\hat{j} \\] This equation shows that the object experiences constant downward acceleration due to gravity while moving freely in space. 3. Equations of Motion Projectile motion consists of two independent components : Horizontal Motion ( \\(x\\) -direction) : No force acts in the horizontal direction, so acceleration is zero. \\[ \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = 0 \\] The horizontal velocity remains constant: \\[ v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\] The horizontal position as a function of time: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t \\] Vertical Motion ( \\(y\\) -direction) : Gravity is the only force acting, so acceleration is: \\[ \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -g \\] The vertical velocity changes over time: \\[ v_y = v_0 \\sin\\theta - gt \\] The vertical position equation: \\[ y(t) = h + v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] 4. Time of Flight The total time the projectile spends in the air is obtained by solving for \\(T\\) when the projectile lands ( \\(y(T) = 0\\) ): \\[ h + v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot T - \\frac{1}{2} g T^2 = 0 \\] Solving for \\(T\\) using the quadratic formula: \\[ T = \\frac{v_0 \\sin\\theta + \\sqrt{(v_0 \\sin\\theta)^2 + 2gh}}{g} \\] This equation gives the total duration the projectile remains airborne. 5. Range Equation The range ( \\(R\\) ) is the total horizontal distance traveled: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot T \\] Substituting \\(T\\) : \\[ R = \\frac{v_0 \\cos\\theta (v_0 \\sin\\theta + \\sqrt{(v_0 \\sin\\theta)^2 + 2gh})}{g} \\] For flat ground ( \\(h = 0\\) ), the well-known formula simplifies to: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] This equation tells us that the maximum range occurs at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) , assuming no air resistance. Python Visualization: Collab Visualization: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OJ9PvOWkqUUzbr23i4xrCo_lYyVzG-4J Projectile Range vs. Launch Angle Introduction The plot represents the relationship between the range of a projectile and its launch angle in a uniform gravitational field, assuming no air resistance . It shows how the horizontal displacement of a projectile changes with different launch angles. Understanding the Axes X-axis ( Launch Angle (degrees) ) : Represents the angle at which the projectile is launched, ranging from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 . Y-axis ( Range (meters) ) : Represents the horizontal distance (range) the projectile travels before hitting the ground. Key Observations from the Graph The curve is symmetric about 45\u00b0 , meaning that launching a projectile at an angle \u03b8 gives the same range as launching at 90\u00b0 - \u03b8 . For example, 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 provide the same range. The maximum range occurs at 45\u00b0 , which is highlighted by the red dashed vertical line. As the launch angle increases from 0\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 , the range increases . Beyond 45\u00b0 , the range decreases , reaching 0 again at 90\u00b0 . Physics Behind the Graph The range R of a projectile launched with initial velocity v\u2080 at angle \u03b8 is given by: $ R = \\frac{v\u2080^2 \\sin(2\u03b8)}{g} $ where: - v\u2080 is the initial velocity, - g is the acceleration due to gravity ( 9.81 m/s\u00b2 on Earth), - \u03b8 is the launch angle. Why is Maximum Range at 45\u00b0? The range formula contains sin(2\u03b8) , which reaches its maximum when 2\u03b8 = 90\u00b0 , i.e., \u03b8 = 45\u00b0 . At 45\u00b0 , the horizontal and vertical components of velocity are equal , maximizing the distance covered before the projectile lands. Legend Explanation Blue Curve : \"Range vs Angle\" - This shows how the range varies with launch angle. Red Dashed Line at 45\u00b0 : \"Max Range at 45\u00b0\" - Highlights the optimal angle for achieving the longest range. Conclusion This plot illustrates the fundamental principle of projectile motion: the launch angle of 45\u00b0 provides the maximum range in an idealized environment. The symmetry of the curve reflects the trade-off between vertical and horizontal components of velocity as the angle changes. Collab Visualization: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pjSAtyFPm4nVpRGA02_JjOp854q0Tnnk Projectile Motion for Different Initial Velocities and Angles Introduction This graph illustrates the trajectory of projectiles launched at different initial velocities ( v\u2080 ) and launch angles ( \u03b8 ). The trajectories follow parabolic paths , which is a fundamental characteristic of motion under uniform gravitational acceleration. Understanding the Axes X-axis ( Horizontal Distance (m) ) : Represents the horizontal displacement of the projectile. Y-axis ( Vertical Distance (m) ) : Represents the height of the projectile at different points in its trajectory. Legend Explanation The legend on the right specifies different launch conditions: - Solid Lines represent projectiles launched at \u03b8 = 45\u00b0 with different initial velocities ( 30 m/s , 40 m/s , 50 m/s ). - Dashed Lines indicate projectiles launched at different angles ( 15\u00b0 and 75\u00b0 ) but with the same initial velocity ( 50 m/s ). Each curve represents the path taken by a projectile under a given launch condition. Key Observations Effect of Increasing Initial Velocity ( v\u2080 ) at 45\u00b0 : The blue, orange, and green curves correspond to increasing values of v\u2080 = 30, 40, 50 m/s , respectively. As v\u2080 increases, both maximum height and range increase. The projectile with v\u2080 = 50 m/s (green) covers the greatest horizontal distance. Effect of Different Launch Angles at v\u2080 = 50 m/s : The red dashed curve ( 15\u00b0 ) has a lower trajectory and a shorter range due to its low vertical component. The brown dashed curve ( 75\u00b0 ) has a much higher peak but a shorter horizontal range , as more energy is directed into vertical motion. The green solid curve ( 45\u00b0 ) has the maximum range , confirming that 45\u00b0 is the optimal angle for distance in ideal projectile motion. Physics Behind the Graph The motion follows the kinematic equations: Equations of Motion Horizontal Position: $ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t $ Determines how far the projectile moves in the horizontal direction. The horizontal velocity remains constant (assuming no air resistance). Vertical Position: $ y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $ The projectile first rises, slows down due to gravity, and then falls back to the ground. Time of Flight: $ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} $ Higher launch angles result in longer flight times. Range: $ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $ R is maximized at \u03b8 = 45\u00b0 in the absence of air resistance. Maximum Height: $ H = \\frac{(v_0 \\sin(\\theta))^2}{2g} $ Larger \u03b8 results in a higher peak. Conclusion The optimal launch angle for maximum range is 45\u00b0 . Increasing initial velocity ( v\u2080 ) increases both range and height. Lower angles ( 15\u00b0 ) result in a flatter trajectory with less height. Higher angles ( 75\u00b0 ) yield greater height but shorter range. The trajectories are parabolic , as expected for projectile motion under uniform gravity. This plot effectively demonstrates the effect of velocity and angle on projectile motion.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#mechanics-problem-1-investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"Mechanics Problem 1: Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-introduction-and-motivation","text":"Projectile motion is one of the most fundamental topics in mechanics, with applications in sports, ballistics, space exploration, and engineering.

The forced damped pendulum is a powerful example of a nonlinear system that exhibits a range of behaviors: - Simple harmonic motion (for small angles & low damping). - Resonance phenomena (for specific driving frequencies). - Quasiperiodic and chaotic motion (for higher forcing & damping). Real-World Applications: \u2705 Engineering \u2013 Vibrations in bridges, buildings, and mechanical structures . \u2705 Energy Harvesting \u2013 Oscillators for power generation in wearable devices. \u2705 Climate Science \u2013 Quasiperiodic oscillations in weather patterns. \u2705 Neuroscience \u2013 Modeling neural oscillations and circadian rhythms. \u2705 Electrical Circuits \u2013 Analogous to RLC circuits driven by AC sources. Understanding the transition from order to chaos in this system helps in designing stable structures , controlling oscillations , and predicting system failures . \ud83c\udfd7 Mathematical Model: The Forced Damped Pendulum Equation The equation of motion for a forced damped pendulum is: $$ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega t) $$ where: - $ \\theta $ = Angular displacement. - \\(b\\) = Damping coefficient (frictional resistance). - \\(g\\) = Acceleration due to gravity. - \\(L\\) = Length of the pendulum. - \\(A\\) = Amplitude of the external periodic forcing. - \\(\\omega\\) = Driving frequency of the external force. For small angles ( \\(\\theta \\approx \\sin\\theta\\) ), the equation simplifies to a driven damped harmonic oscillator , but for larger angles, nonlinear effects dominate. \ud83d\udda5 Python Implementation & Visualizations \ud83d\udccc 1. Time Evolution of the Pendulum Motion This plot shows how angular displacement \\(\\theta(t)\\) and angular velocity \\(\\omega(t)\\) change over time. Python Visualization: Collab Visualizations: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HdLCwRAtk3ty0qajcd27SlMUS8OqSkiG \ud83d\udccc Explanation of the Visualizations **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Forced Damped Pendulum Motion \ud83d\udd0d Description: This plot shows how the angular displacement ( \\(\\theta\\) ) evolves over time for a forced damped pendulum . The pendulum is subject to damping (frictional forces) and external periodic forcing , which creates an oscillatory pattern . \ud83d\udcca Observations: Initially, the amplitude of oscillations increases , indicating that the system is approaching a steady-state oscillation . After a certain period, the oscillations stabilize , meaning the pendulum has settled into a periodic response to the external driving force. The frequency of oscillations is determined by the driving force frequency rather than the pendulum\u2019s natural frequency. The damping coefficient ensures that transient effects (initial irregular motion) die out over time. \ud83d\udccc Key Takeaways: \u2705 Energy balance : Energy lost due to damping is continuously replaced by the external driving force. \u2705 Resonance possibility : If the driving force frequency matches the natural frequency, resonance can occur , leading to larger oscillations. \u2705 Application : This behavior is commonly seen in mechanical oscillators, bridges, and electrical circuits (e.g., forced RLC circuits). 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Damped Pendulum Motion \ud83d\udd0d Description: This plot shows both angular displacement \\(\\theta(t)\\) ( solid orange curve ) and angular velocity \\(\\omega(t)\\) ( dashed red curve ) over time. The system is a damped pendulum , meaning frictional forces cause a gradual reduction in motion over time. \ud83d\udcca Observations: The displacement \\(\\theta(t)\\) starts with a relatively large amplitude , but over time, the amplitude decreases due to damping. The angular velocity \\(\\omega(t)\\) follows a similar pattern, oscillating out of phase with the displacement. The damping causes exponential decay in amplitude, leading to smaller oscillations as time progresses. Eventually, the system will reach equilibrium (zero motion) if no external force is applied. \ud83d\udccc Key Takeaways: \u2705 Damping reduces oscillations : This is important in engineering applications where excessive vibrations need to be controlled (e.g., automobile suspensions ). \u2705 Phase relation : The velocity \\(\\omega(t)\\) leads the displacement \\(\\theta(t)\\) in a sinusoidal pattern, a characteristic of oscillatory motion. \u2705 Application : Understanding damping is crucial for mechanical design, seismic engineering, and electronic circuits (e.g., RLC damped circuits). \ud83c\udfd7 Overall Insights The first image represents a forced system where oscillations are maintained due to an external periodic force. The second image represents a naturally damped system where oscillations decay over time. Together, these plots highlight the fundamental differences between free damped motion and externally forced motion . Poincar\u00e9 Section of a Forced Damped Pendulum Understanding the Poincar\u00e9 Section A Poincar\u00e9 section is a technique used in dynamical systems analysis to study periodic or chaotic behavior by sampling points in phase space at discrete time intervals. In this case, it represents the forced damped pendulum system at a specific phase of the external driving force. Components of the Plot Axes: X-axis (\u03b8 in radians): Represents the angular position of the pendulum. Y-axis (\u03c9 in rad/s): Represents the angular velocity of the pendulum. Data Points: The red dots represent the state of the pendulum at discrete time intervals when the system crosses a predefined phase of the external forcing. The clustering of points suggests periodic behavior, while scattered points may indicate chaotic motion. Interpretation of the Poincar\u00e9 Section Periodic Motion: If the system is periodic, the Poincar\u00e9 section will consist of a finite number of distinct points. In the given plot, there appears to be a strong clustering of points around a particular value of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\omega\\) , suggesting periodic motion. Quasi-Periodic Motion: If the system is quasi-periodic, the points form a closed curve or a toroidal shape in higher dimensions. Chaotic Behavior: A scattered, seemingly random distribution of points would indicate chaotic behavior. The presence of some outlier points may suggest transitions between periodic and chaotic behavior. Key Observations The dense vertical clustering around \\(\\theta \\approx 0.208\\) rad and \\(\\omega \\approx 0.027\\) rad/s suggests a periodic attractor. Some outlier points indicate that the system might have transient or weak chaotic behavior. The periodicity of the pendulum is evident from the regular pattern of points. Conclusion The Poincar\u00e9 section provides insights into the dynamical nature of the forced damped pendulum. The observed pattern suggests that the system is likely in a periodic regime, with possible indications of complex dynamics in the form of outliers. Explanation of the Simple Pendulum Motion (Undamped) Overview: The following plot represents the motion of an undamped simple pendulum , where the system undergoes simple harmonic motion . In this system, there is no damping or external forcing, meaning the pendulum will oscillate indefinitely without any reduction in amplitude. The motion is purely governed by the force of gravity. Mathematical Model: The motion of an undamped simple pendulum is governed by the equation: $$ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin(\\theta) = 0 $$ Where: - \\(\\theta\\) = Angular displacement (in radians), - \\(g\\) = Gravitational acceleration ( \\(9.81 \\, m/s^2\\) ), - \\(L\\) = Length of the pendulum. This equation is derived from the Newtonian mechanics of the pendulum and describes how the angular displacement of the pendulum changes over time. For small oscillations, the equation simplifies to simple harmonic motion, but for large angles, the equation remains nonlinear. Key Parameters: \\(\\theta_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) (Initial angle: 45 degrees), \\(\\omega_0 = 0\\) (Initial angular velocity: 0), \\(L = 1.0\\) (Length of the pendulum in meters), \\(g = 9.81\\) (Acceleration due to gravity). Plot Description: The plot shows the time evolution of: - Angular displacement ( \\(\\theta(t)\\) ) in orange : This represents the position of the pendulum at each time. - Angular velocity ( \\(\\omega(t)\\) ) in red dashed lines : This represents the speed at which the pendulum is moving at each point in time. Observations: The angular displacement oscillates in a sinusoidal pattern, characteristic of simple harmonic motion, with a constant amplitude and frequency. The angular velocity leads the displacement by 90 degrees (a characteristic feature of harmonic oscillators), and its magnitude is maximum when the pendulum is passing through the equilibrium position. Since the pendulum is undamped, the oscillations continue indefinitely with constant amplitude. Key Takeaways: Harmonic Motion : The pendulum follows simple harmonic motion, meaning the angular displacement oscillates sinusoidally with a fixed period. Energy Conservation : In an undamped system, no energy is lost to friction or resistance, so the amplitude of the oscillations remains constant over time. Phase Relationship : The angular velocity leads the angular displacement by 90 degrees, indicating that the motion is out of phase with the position. Application : This model is a good approximation for small-angle oscillations of pendulums and is used in simple physics demonstrations of harmonic motion. Conclusion: The plot demonstrates the periodic, undamped motion of a pendulum where the displacement and velocity follow sinusoidal patterns over time. The simple harmonic motion is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering, and this model can be applied to a variety of systems experiencing similar oscillatory behavior. This type of system is useful for understanding basic principles of mechanics, such as oscillation frequency, phase relationships, and energy conservation in idealized conditions. Phase Space Diagrams 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Simple Pendulum with \\(b = 0\\) and \\(A = 0\\) The simple pendulum is a classic example of a nonlinear dynamical system. When there is no damping ( \\(b = 0\\) ) and no external forcing ( \\(A = 0\\) ), the pendulum's motion is purely governed by gravity. The phase space diagram shows how the pendulum's angular position \\(\\theta\\) and angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) evolve over time. Phase Space Characteristics: Closed Orbits : In the absence of damping and forcing, the phase space trajectory of the simple pendulum is closed , indicating periodic motion. Conservation of Energy : The total energy (kinetic + potential) remains constant, as there is no energy loss or input. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Forced Pendulum with \\(b = 0\\) and \\(A \\neq 0\\) When the pendulum is driven by an external periodic force (i.e., \\(A \\neq 0\\) ), the system exhibits forced oscillations. The driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) and amplitude \\(A\\) determine the behavior of the system. Phase Space Characteristics: Non-Closed Orbits : In the forced system, the phase space trajectory is no longer closed because the external force constantly adds energy into the system. Resonance : If the frequency of the external force matches the pendulum\u2019s natural frequency, the amplitude of oscillations can increase significantly, leading to resonance. Comparison of Phase Space: The simple pendulum shows periodic motion with closed orbits, while the forced pendulum demonstrates a more complex pattern due to the external driving force. The forced pendulum can exhibit resonance when the driving frequency aligns with the system's natural frequency, as seen in the expanded phase space trajectory. Conclusion on Phase Space: Phase space diagrams help to visualize the dynamics of the pendulum, allowing us to distinguish between periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic behaviors, and understand the impact of damping and forcing on the system. Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Lh0OVNaiavsvggUu-QJTk1F2hrZjLbne Explanation of the Phase Space Diagrams 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Phase Space of Damped Pendulum (No Forcing) Description: This plot represents the phase space of a damped pendulum system where there is no external forcing . The system experiences damping , which reduces the amplitude of oscillations over time. The variables plotted are: - X-axis : Angular displacement ( \\(\\theta\\) ), the position of the pendulum. - Y-axis : Angular velocity ( \\(\\omega\\) ), the speed at which the pendulum is moving. Observations: The trajectory forms a spiral that moves inward toward the origin. This indicates that the pendulum's oscillations are decaying due to damping . As the system evolves, the amplitude of the oscillations gradually decreases , eventually leading to zero displacement and velocity at the center (the origin), which signifies the system coming to rest. The system exhibits damped harmonic motion , where energy is dissipated over time due to friction or resistance, which is why the spiral path decays. Key Takeaways: The damping causes the energy of the system to dissipate over time, reducing the amplitude of oscillations. Eventually, the system will settle into equilibrium (zero motion). This phase space diagram is typical for systems like automobile suspensions , seismic engineering , or RLC circuits in electronics where damping plays an essential role. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Phase Space of Driven Harmonic Oscillator (With Sinusoidal Force) Description: This plot represents the phase space of a driven harmonic oscillator . In this system, there is an external periodic force acting on the pendulum, which drives it to oscillate. The system is influenced by the external force but has no damping. The variables plotted are: - X-axis : Angular displacement ( \\(\\theta\\) ), the position of the pendulum. - Y-axis : Angular velocity ( \\(\\omega\\) ), the speed at which the pendulum is moving. Observations: The phase space trajectory forms closed loops instead of spirals. This is typical for driven systems , where the system oscillates in a periodic manner due to the external force. Unlike the damped system, the motion here does not decay but continues in a steady oscillatory state due to the periodic driving force. The shape and size of the loops are determined by the amplitude and frequency of the external force. The system reaches a steady state where the amplitude of oscillations is constant, driven by the energy input from the external force. Key Takeaways: Resonance : If the frequency of the driving force matches the system's natural frequency, resonance will occur, and the amplitude of oscillations will increase significantly. Steady oscillations : The system reaches a steady oscillatory state where the motion is periodic. This phase space diagram is useful in systems like forced RLC circuits , mechanical oscillators , and vibrating systems in engineering, where external forces drive the motion. 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Comparison Between Damped and Driven Systems Comparison Overview: The damped pendulum shows a decaying oscillation , leading to eventual rest due to energy loss over time. The driven harmonic oscillator shows steady oscillations maintained by an external periodic force, which keeps the system oscillating indefinitely without damping. Observations: In the damped pendulum phase space , the system spirals inward, indicating the loss of energy and the eventual cessation of motion. In the driven oscillator phase space , the system shows closed orbits , indicating that the pendulum is in a steady oscillatory state driven by the external force. Key Takeaways: Damping causes energy dissipation and leads to eventual equilibrium (no motion). External forcing maintains continuous oscillations, and the system does not lose energy over time. The phase space trajectory can provide valuable insights into the long-term behavior of oscillating systems, helping engineers and scientists understand how different forces affect motion in mechanical, electrical, and natural systems. Conclusion These phase space diagrams highlight the differences between damped, driven, and forced oscillatory systems. They provide a visual understanding of how energy dissipation , external forcing , and system damping influence the behavior of mechanical systems. The insights gained from these diagrams are crucial in designing systems that either require stability or that can be driven efficiently by external forces.","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#problem-2","text":"","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#investigating-the-dynamics-of-a-forced-damped-pendulum","text":"","title":"\ud83d\udccc Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#motivation-why-study-the-forced-damped-pendulum","text":"The forced damped pendulum is a powerful example of a nonlinear system that exhibits a range of behaviors: - Simple harmonic motion (for small angles & low damping). - Resonance phenomena (for specific driving frequencies). - Quasiperiodic and chaotic motion (for higher forcing & damping).","title":"Motivation: Why Study the Forced Damped Pendulum?"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#real-world-applications","text":"\u2705 Engineering \u2013 Vibrations in bridges, buildings, and mechanical structures . \u2705 Energy Harvesting \u2013 Oscillators for power generation in wearable devices. \u2705 Climate Science \u2013 Quasiperiodic oscillations in weather patterns. \u2705 Neuroscience \u2013 Modeling neural oscillations and circadian rhythms. \u2705 Electrical Circuits \u2013 Analogous to RLC circuits driven by AC sources.

Introduction Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period (T) of a planet is proportional to the cube of its semi-major axis (r). Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as: \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) For circular orbits, this can be derived from Newton\u2019s Law of Gravitation and centripetal force considerations. In this document, we will: - Derive Kepler's Third Law for circular orbits. - Discuss its significance in astronomy. - Analyze real-world examples. - Implement a computational simulation of circular orbits. 2. Derivation of Kepler\u2019s Third Law for Circular Orbits A planet or satellite in a circular orbit experiences a centripetal force due to gravity. According to Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation: \\(F = \\frac{G M m}{r^2}\\) where: - \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant ( \\(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}\\) ), - \\(M\\) is the mass of the central body (e.g., the Sun for planets, Earth for satellites), - \\(m\\) is the mass of the orbiting object, - \\(r\\) is the orbital radius. For circular motion, the necessary centripetal force is given by: \\(F = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\) Since the orbital velocity \\(v\\) is related to the orbital period \\(T\\) by: \\(v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\) Equating the gravitational force and centripetal force: \\(\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m (2\\pi r)^2}{T^2 r}\\) Canceling \\(m\\) and simplifying: \\(\\frac{G M}{r^2} = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 r}{T^2}\\) Rearranging for \\(T^2\\) : \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3\\) This confirms that \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) , which is Kepler\u2019s Third Law. 3. Implications for Astronomy Allows astronomers to determine the masses of celestial bodies by observing orbital periods and distances. Used in calculating satellite orbits and designing space missions. Helps understand the structure of planetary systems. Real-World Examples The Moon\u2019s orbit around Earth: The Moon\u2019s period (T) and distance (r) conform to Kepler\u2019s Law. Planets in the Solar System: The relationship \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) holds accurately for planetary orbits around the Sun. 4. Computational Model for Circular Orbits Below is a Python script that simulates a circular orbit and verifies the \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) relationship using numerical data. 5. Extending to Elliptical Orbits Kepler\u2019s Third Law applies to elliptical orbits as well, with \\(r\\) replaced by the semi-major axis \\(a\\) . For an elliptical orbit: \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{G(M + m)}\\) where \\(a\\) is the average of the perihelion and aphelion distances. This law helps in understanding binary stars and exoplanets. 6. Conclusion Kepler\u2019s Third Law provides a fundamental link between orbital mechanics and gravitational forces. By implementing computational simulations, we verify that \\(T^2\\) is indeed proportional to \\(r^3\\) , confirming its validity in both theoretical and real-world scenarios. Collab link https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MS_gOcNBZMEoS0KIUzI9aBXFoH75FxZu Visualization of Kepler\u2019s Third Law and Circular Orbits 1. Plotting $ T^2 $ vs. $ r^3 $ The first visualization is a plot of the square of the orbital period $ T^2 $ versus the cube of the orbital radius $ r^3 $ to validate Kepler\u2019s Third Law. The relationship between these two quantities should be a straight line, confirming the proportionality $ T^2 \\propto r^3 $. Key Points: The x-axis represents the cube of the orbital radius $ r^3 $ in meters cubed ($ m^3 $). The y-axis represents the square of the orbital period $ T^2 $ in seconds squared ($ s^2 $). The blue dots represent the data points for planets in the Solar System (from Mercury to Neptune). The dashed red line is the best-fit line showing the proportional relationship between $ T^2 $ and $ r^3 $. As you can see from the plot, the data points align closely with the theoretical curve, verifying Kepler's Third Law. The relationship suggests that the further a planet is from the Sun, the longer its orbital period. Conclusion: This plot visually demonstrates that the orbital period squared is directly proportional to the orbital radius cubed. It serves as a direct validation of Kepler\u2019s Third Law using real-world planetary data. 2. Visualization of Circular Orbits The second visualization demonstrates the concept of planets moving in circular orbits around the Sun. In this plot, we represent the orbits of planets such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Key Points: The yellow dot at the center represents the Sun , the central gravitational force for all planets. Each circular orbit represents a planet orbiting the Sun at different distances. The planets\u2019 positions are calculated using their orbital radii (in AU), which are the average distances from the Sun. The orbits are shown as circles to represent the idealized circular paths of the planets. This plot provides a clear visualization of the orbital paths of the planets. The radii of the circles increase as you move outward from the Sun, showing that the planets farther from the Sun take longer to complete an orbit, as confirmed by Kepler\u2019s Third Law. Conclusion: This plot visually simplifies the concept of circular orbits around a central star (in this case, the Sun). It helps to understand how the orbital radius increases with distance from the Sun, correlating with longer orbital periods for planets farther away. Conclusion of Both Visualizations Together, these two visualizations provide: 1. A mathematical validation of Kepler's Third Law by plotting \\(T^2\\) vs. \\(r^3\\) , demonstrating that the orbital period squared is proportional to the orbital radius cubed. 2. A conceptual demonstration of the orbits of planets around the Sun, showing how distance from the Sun influences the time it takes for a planet to complete one orbit. These visualizations provide a deep understanding of how Kepler's laws describe planetary motion and can be used to make predictions about orbital characteristics of celestial bodies. Simulated Circular Orbits Overview This plot represents a simulation of circular orbits in an astronomical system, with the Sun at the center. The orbits are depicted as concentric circles, each corresponding to a specific radius (r) in Astronomical Units (AU) . Key Components 1. Orbits Each circular orbit represents a different distance from the center. The radii are labeled in the legend: r = 0.39 AU (Innermost orbit) r = 0.72 AU r = 1.0 AU r = 1.52 AU r = 5.2 AU r = 9.58 AU r = 19.22 AU r = 30.05 AU (Outermost orbit) These distances resemble the approximate orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in the Solar System. 2. Sun Representation The Sun is represented by a yellow circle at the center (0,0) , serving as the gravitational center. 3. Axes Labels The X-axis and Y-axis are labeled in Astronomical Units (AU) , which is the standard unit of measurement for distances in the Solar System ( 1 AU \u2248 149.6 million km ). 4. Legend The legend is located in the upper-right corner , listing each orbit's radius with a corresponding color. It also includes a Sun label with a yellow color. 5. Grid and Aesthetics The plot contains grid lines to help visualize the spatial positioning of the orbits. The orbits are centered at (0,0) , ensuring a symmetrical layout. Interpretation This visualization simplifies planetary motion by assuming perfectly circular orbits . In reality, planets follow elliptical orbits as described by Kepler\u2019s Laws of planetary motion. However, for many practical applications, assuming circular orbits provides a good approximation. Conclusion The image effectively illustrates a basic orbital structure with correctly scaled distances. The Sun-centric nature of the model aligns with the heliocentric model of our Solar System.

On a water surface, this can be readily observed when ripples from different points meet, leading to the formation of interference patterns. These patterns can demonstrate various interactions, including constructive interference (wave reinforcement) and destructive interference (wave cancellation). Understanding these interference patterns helps us gain insights into wave behavior in a simple, visual manner. This is essential for grasping the principles of wave superposition and how multiple waves interact. Moreover, it offers an engaging and practical approach to exploring wave dynamics, which has applications in various real-world scenarios, such as acoustics, optics, and fluid dynamics. Task: The goal of this task is to analyze the interference patterns that arise when waves are emitted from multiple point sources placed at the vertices of a regular polygon. Each point source emits a circular wave described by the Single Disturbance equation: \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{r}} \\cdot \\cos(k r - \\omega t + \\phi) \\] Where: - \\(\\eta(x, y, t)\\) represents the displacement of the water surface at point \\((x, y)\\) at time \\(t\\) . - \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the wave. - \\(k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\) is the wave number, which is related to the wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) . - \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f\\) is the angular frequency, related to the frequency \\(f\\) of the wave. - \\(r = \\sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}\\) is the distance between the source located at \\((x_0, y_0)\\) and the observation point \\((x, y)\\) . - \\(\\phi\\) is the initial phase of the wave. Problem Statement: We are tasked with studying the interference patterns formed on a water surface when multiple point sources of waves are placed at the vertices of a regular polygon (e.g., an equilateral triangle, square, regular pentagon, etc.). The objective is to: 1. Set up the wave equations for each source. 2. Apply the principle of superposition by summing the displacements from all sources. 3. Analyze the resulting interference patterns to identify regions of constructive and destructive interference. Steps to Follow: 1. Select a Regular Polygon : The first step is to choose a regular polygon. Common choices include: - Equilateral triangle (3 vertices), - Square (4 vertices), - Regular pentagon (5 vertices), and so on. Each polygon has a specific number of vertices, which will determine the number of point sources from which the waves emanate. 2. Position the Sources : The sources are placed at the vertices of the selected polygon. In polar coordinates, the vertices are evenly distributed on a circle. The angle between consecutive sources can be calculated as: $$ \\theta_i = \\frac{2\\pi i}{N} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad i = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1 $$ Where \\(N\\) is the number of sources (or the number of vertices of the polygon). The positions of the sources are then: $$ x_i = R \\cos(\\theta_i) $$ $$ y_i = R \\sin(\\theta_i) $$ Where \\(R\\) is the radius of the circle inscribed around the polygon. 3. Write the Wave Equations : Each source emits a wave described by the equation: $$ \\eta_i(x, y, t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{r_i}} \\cdot \\cos(k r_i - \\omega t + \\phi) $$ Where \\(r_i\\) is the distance from the source at \\((x_i, y_i)\\) to the point \\((x, y)\\) : $$ r_i = \\sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2} $$ 4. Superposition of Waves : The total displacement at any point \\((x, y)\\) on the water surface is the sum of the displacements caused by all the sources. According to the principle of superposition: $$ \\eta_{\\text{sum}}(x, y, t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\eta_i(x, y, t) $$ The total displacement results from adding the contributions from all sources. Depending on the relative phases of the waves from the sources, we may observe regions of constructive interference (where the waves reinforce each other) or destructive interference (where the waves cancel each other out). 5. Analyze Interference Patterns : The interference patterns can be visualized by plotting the total displacement \\(\\eta_{\\text{sum}}(x, y, t)\\) at various points on the water surface. Regions of constructive interference will show up as areas of high displacement, while regions of destructive interference will show low or zero displacement. By examining the patterns for different polygons, we can observe how the symmetry and number of sources affect the interference. Colab Visualizations: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GeyAPchrlodXF4B5WXIblvuSDmE1Q2FH ! Explanation of the Interference Pattern Visualization The code provided simulates and visualizes the interference patterns created by waves emitted from point sources placed at the vertices of a regular polygon (in this case, an equilateral triangle with 3 sources). The goal of the visualization is to show how the superposition of waves from multiple sources creates a complex interference pattern on a water surface. Visualization Overview: The plot generated by the code is a contour plot that represents the displacement of the water surface at each point on the grid. The color intensity in the plot corresponds to the displacement of the water surface at that point, with warmer colors (like red) representing regions of higher displacement (constructive interference), and cooler colors (like blue) representing regions of lower displacement (destructive interference). Key Features of the Visualization: Grid Representation : The water surface is modeled as a 2D grid of points in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions. This grid is created using np.meshgrid , which generates a grid of points from the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) ranges defined earlier. The grid spans from -size to size in both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions, giving a 2D plane on which the wave displacements are calculated. Source Placement : The point sources (located at the vertices of a regular polygon) are positioned on a circle with a radius of 3 units. For an equilateral triangle, the vertices are placed at 120-degree intervals around this circle. The positions of the sources are calculated using the cos and sin functions based on the angle theta , which is evenly spaced between the sources. Wave Displacement Calculation : For each point on the grid, the displacement is calculated by summing the contributions from each point source using the formula: $$ \\eta_i(x, y, t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{r}} \\cdot \\cos(k r - \\omega t + \\phi) $$ Where: - \\(r\\) is the distance from the source to the grid point \\((x, y)\\) . - \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the wave, \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength, \\(f\\) is the frequency, and \\(\\phi\\) is the phase. The total displacement \\(\\eta_{\\text{sum}}(x, y, t)\\) is the sum of the displacements from all sources. Interference Pattern : The interference pattern shows regions where the waves from the different sources interact. Areas of constructive interference occur where the waves reinforce each other, leading to higher displacement values (depicted as warmer colors in the plot). Conversely, areas of destructive interference occur where the waves cancel each other out, leading to lower displacement values (depicted as cooler colors in the plot). Color Map : The contourf function is used to create filled contour plots, which show the intensity of the displacement. The RdBu colormap is used to represent the positive and negative displacements, with red indicating higher displacement (constructive interference) and blue indicating lower displacement (destructive interference). A color bar is included to help interpret the displacement values, with higher values corresponding to regions of constructive interference. Title and Axes : The plot title indicates the number of sources used in the simulation (in this case, 3 sources, corresponding to an equilateral triangle). The axes represent the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates on the water surface. The plot is scaled to ensure the axes have equal lengths, meaning the aspect ratio of the plot is kept consistent ( plt.axis(\"equal\") ). Observations: In the case of the equilateral triangle (3 sources), the plot shows a symmetrical interference pattern . The central region of the plot likely exhibits constructive interference with high displacement, while areas further from the center show alternating regions of constructive and destructive interference. The symmetry of the polygon influences the shape and spacing of the interference fringes. For example, for 3 sources, the pattern will have rotational symmetry around the center of the polygon. As the number of sources (vertices of the polygon) increases, the interference pattern will become more complex and may show finer fringes of constructive and destructive interference. Conclusion: This visualization helps to illustrate the principles of wave superposition and interference. By analyzing the interference pattern, we can gain insights into how multiple coherent wave sources interact and how their positions affect the resulting pattern of constructive and destructive interference. Explanation of the Interference Pattern for a Square Configuration The generated plot represents the interference pattern created by waves emitted from four point sources placed at the vertices of a square. Similar to the previous simulation with an equilateral triangle, the goal here is to visualize how the superposition of waves from multiple sources creates regions of constructive and destructive interference. Visualization Overview: The plot is a contour plot that shows the displacement of the water surface at each point on the grid. The intensity of the color corresponds to the displacement, with warmer colors (like red) representing higher displacement (constructive interference), and cooler colors (like blue) representing lower displacement (destructive interference). Key Features of the Visualization: Source Placement : The point sources are positioned at the vertices of a square . The coordinates of the four sources are at \\((x_1, y_1) = (-3, 3)\\) , \\((x_2, y_2) = (3, 3)\\) , \\((x_3, y_3) = (3, -3)\\) , and \\((x_4, y_4) = (-3, -3)\\) . These points are evenly spaced at 90-degree intervals. Grid Representation : The grid spans from -size to size in both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions, creating a 2D plane that represents the water surface. The displacement at each point on the grid is calculated based on the superposition of waves from the four sources. Wave Displacement Calculation : The displacement at each point \\((x, y)\\) is calculated by summing the contributions of the four sources using the wave formula: $$ \\eta_i(x, y, t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{r}} \\cdot \\cos(k r - \\omega t + \\phi) $$ Where \\(r\\) is the distance between the source at \\((x_i, y_i)\\) and the observation point \\((x, y)\\) , and \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the wave. Interference Pattern : The resulting interference pattern exhibits regions of constructive interference , where the waves from multiple sources reinforce each other, and destructive interference , where the waves cancel each other out. The plot shows alternating regions of higher and lower displacement, with constructive interference leading to higher displacement (shown in warmer colors) and destructive interference leading to lower displacement (shown in cooler colors). Color Map : The contourf function is used to create filled contours, which display the intensity of the displacement. The RdBu colormap is used, with red colors indicating high displacement (constructive interference) and blue colors indicating low displacement (destructive interference). A color bar is included to indicate the displacement values corresponding to different colors. Symmetry : The square configuration introduces fourfold symmetry in the interference pattern. The pattern is symmetric around the center of the square, with alternating regions of constructive and destructive interference appearing in each quadrant. Observations: The interference pattern generated by the four sources placed at the vertices of a square shows clear symmetry . This symmetry is a result of the equal spacing between the sources and their arrangement at 90-degree intervals. Constructive interference occurs near the center of the square, where the waves from the sources meet in-phase and reinforce each other, leading to higher displacement. Destructive interference occurs at other regions, where the waves from different sources meet out-of-phase and cancel each other out, leading to lower displacement.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#interference-patterns-on-a-water-surface","text":"","title":"Interference Patterns on a Water Surface"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#motivation","text":"Interference is a fundamental phenomenon in wave mechanics, where waves from different sources overlap and combine to form new patterns.

Background Concepts 2.1 Graph Theory Fundamentals A graph \\(G=(V,E)\\) consists of: Vertices (nodes) \\(V\\) : Represent circuit junctions Edges \\(E\\) : Represent resistors, optionally weighted Graph types in NetworkX: Graph \u2014 undirected, no parallel edges MultiGraph \u2014 undirected, supports parallel edges DiGraph / MultiDiGraph \u2014 directed variants 2.2 Electrical Circuit Basics Series resistors : share a single junction \u2192 \\(R_\\text{eq}=R_1+R_2\\) Parallel resistors : share both end-nodes \u2192 \\(\\frac1{R_\\text{eq}}=\\frac1{R_1}+\\frac1{R_2}\\) Delta\u2013Y (Star\u2013Delta) : transforms triangular loops into trees when no simple series/parallel applies Why Use Graph Theory? In electrical engineering, calculating equivalent resistance is essential for analyzing circuits. Traditionally, we simplify circuits by: Combining resistors in series (add them) Combining resistors in parallel (use the reciprocal formula) However, for complex circuits , especially those with mixed configurations or multiple loops, manual simplification becomes inefficient or error-prone. Graph theory provides a structured, programmable approach by modeling circuits as graphs . Our goal is to automate this process. Core Idea: Model the Circuit as a Graph A circuit can be seen as a graph : Nodes represent junction points in the circuit Edges represent resistors between nodes, with resistance as a weight or attribute This makes it possible to simplify the circuit algorithmically. NetworkX Graph Types Graph Type Description Use Case Graph Undirected, no parallel edges Simple resistor networks DiGraph Directed graph Circuits with diodes or flow MultiGraph Allows multiple (parallel) edges Circuits with parallel resistors MultiDiGraph Directed with multiple edges Advanced cases with flow + parallel For circuits, we often use MultiGraph to model parallel resistors.

Thus, we can estimate \u03c0 using: \\[ \\pi \\approx 4 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\text{points inside the circle}}{\\text{total points}} \\right) \\] Simulation Process Generate \\(n\\) random points in the square \\([-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]\\) . Determine which points fall inside the unit circle using \\(x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\) . Count the points inside and outside. Use the ratio to estimate \u03c0. Visualization A scatter plot can be created: - Blue points represent those inside the circle. - Red points are outside the circle but within the square. - A black outline indicates the exact circle. This allows us to see the estimation process geometrically . Analysis The accuracy improves as the number of random points increases. For small samples, fluctuations are common. The convergence rate follows the law of large numbers : $$ \\text{Error} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} $$ The method is simple and visual , but converges slowly , requiring many samples for high precision. Part 2: Estimating \u03c0 Using Buffon\u2019s Needle (Probabilistic Geometry) Theoretical Foundation Buffon\u2019s Needle is a classic problem in geometric probability . Imagine dropping a needle of length \\(L\\) onto a surface with parallel horizontal lines spaced distance \\(d\\) apart ( \\(L \\leq d\\) ). The probability that the needle crosses a line is: \\[ P = \\frac{2L}{d\\pi} \\] Rearranging for \u03c0, we estimate it as: \\[ \\pi \\approx \\frac{2L \\cdot n}{d \\cdot h} \\] Where: - \\(n\\) is the total number of needle drops - \\(h\\) is the number of times the needle crosses a line Simulation Process Define \\(L\\) (needle length) and \\(d\\) (distance between lines). Simulate \\(n\\) needle drops: Random center position on the vertical axis. Random angle \\(\\theta\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi\\) . Determine if the needle crosses a line using trigonometric conditions. Estimate \u03c0 using the observed proportion of crossings. Visualization The parallel lines are shown as equally spaced horizontal lines. Each needle is drawn: Red if it crosses a line. Blue if it does not. This creates an engaging geometric probability visualization. Analysis Like the circle-based method, the accuracy improves with more trials. However, this method converges slower and is more sensitive to geometric constraints . It is particularly useful in demonstrating how experimental probability relates to mathematical constants.

Gradually scale up the number of trials to observe convergence. Use libraries like NumPy for efficient sampling and Matplotlib for visual feedback. Ensure uniform random distribution in all simulations for accuracy. Final Note These experiments not only teach us about \\(\\pi\\) , but also about the core ideas of randomness, simulation, convergence, and reproducibility \u2014 foundational principles across mathematics, science, and engineering. colab Monte Carlo Estimation of \\(\\pi\\) \u2013 Geometric Visualization Description This plot demonstrates the Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of \\(\\pi\\) by simulating random points inside a square that bounds a unit circle . The square spans from \\(x = -1\\) to \\(1\\) and \\(y = -1\\) to \\(1\\) . A unit circle is inscribed in the square (radius = 1). 10,000 points were randomly generated within the square. Color Legend Blue points : Lie inside the circle ( \\(x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\) ) Red points : Lie outside the circle but still inside the square \u03c0 Estimation Formula The value of \\(\\pi\\) is estimated using: \\[ \\pi \\approx 4 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\text{points inside circle}}{\\text{total points}} \\right) \\] In this plot, the estimate is: \\[ \\hat{\\pi} \\approx 3.13480 \\quad \\text{(from 10,000 points)} \\] Insights The ratio of blue to total points approximates the area of the circle relative to the square. With more points , the estimate gets closer to the true value of \u03c0 . The plot provides a visual intuition for convergence via geometric probability. This is a foundational example of how randomness and geometry can be used together to estimate fundamental constants like \u03c0. \ud83d\udcc8 Convergence of Monte Carlo Estimation of \\(\\pi\\) What This Plot Shows This graph demonstrates how the Monte Carlo estimate of \\(\\pi\\) evolves as the number of randomly sampled points increases. The blue line represents the cumulative estimate of \\(\\pi\\) after each additional point. The red dashed line indicates the true value of \\(\\pi\\) (approximately 3.14159). Explanation At each simulation step: - A point is randomly placed inside the square \\([-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]\\) - We check whether it lies inside the unit circle: \\(x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\) - We update the estimate of \\(\\pi\\) using: $$ \\pi \\approx 4 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\text{points inside circle}}{\\text{total points}} \\right) $$ Observations Range Behavior First 100 pts High variability and oscillation 500+ pts Gradual convergence toward \\(\\pi\\) 5000\u201310000 Estimate stabilizes near 3.14 The fluctuations early in the process are due to small sample size. Over time, the law of large numbers ensures convergence to the true value. Key Takeaway The Monte Carlo method: - Converges slowly but steadily to an accurate value of \\(\\pi\\) - Becomes more reliable with a larger number of trials - Demonstrates how probabilistic techniques can approximate deterministic values This plot is a perfect example of a stochastic simulation stabilizing around a theoretical constant.","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_2/#problem-2","text":"","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_2/#problem-2-estimating-using-monte-carlo-methods","text":"","title":"Problem 2: Estimating \u03c0 Using Monte Carlo Methods"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_2/#motivation","text":"Monte Carlo methods are a class of algorithms that solve numerical and probabilistic problems by using random sampling .
