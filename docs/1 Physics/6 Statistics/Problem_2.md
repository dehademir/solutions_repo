#  Problem 2: Estimating Ï€ Using Monte Carlo Methods

---

##  Motivation

Monte Carlo methods are a class of algorithms that solve numerical and probabilistic problems by using **random sampling**. One of the most elegant applications is the estimation of the constant Ï€, where randomness and geometry intersect beautifully.

By simulating the outcomes of randomly generated events and observing their relation to geometric boundaries, we can approximate Ï€ in a way that is **intuitive, visual, and computationally insightful**.

This exercise connects key ideas from:
- Probability theory
- Geometric reasoning
- Numerical convergence
- Simulation-based computation

##  Part 1: Estimating Ï€ Using a Circle (Geometric Probability)

###  Theoretical Foundation

Imagine a **unit circle** (radius = 1) perfectly inscribed in a square of side length 2. The area of the square is:

$$
A_{\text{square}} = 2 \times 2 = 4
$$

The area of the unit circle is:

$$
A_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2 = \pi
$$

The ratio of the areas is:

$$
\frac{A_{\text{circle}}}{A_{\text{square}}} = \frac{\pi}{4}
$$

This implies that if we throw random points into the square, the proportion of points that fall **inside the circle** is approximately $\pi/4$. Thus, we can estimate Ï€ using:

$$
\pi \approx 4 \cdot \left( \frac{\text{points inside the circle}}{\text{total points}} \right)
$$

###  Simulation Process

1. Generate $n$ random points in the square $[-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]$.
2. Determine which points fall inside the unit circle using $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$.
3. Count the points inside and outside.
4. Use the ratio to estimate Ï€.

###  Visualization

A scatter plot can be created:
- **Blue points** represent those inside the circle.
- **Red points** are outside the circle but within the square.
- A black outline indicates the exact circle.

This allows us to **see the estimation process geometrically**.

###  Analysis

- The **accuracy improves** as the number of random points increases.
- For small samples, fluctuations are common.
- The convergence rate follows the **law of large numbers**:
  
  $$
  \text{Error} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}
  $$

- The method is **simple and visual**, but **converges slowly**, requiring many samples for high precision.

##  Part 2: Estimating Ï€ Using Buffonâ€™s Needle (Probabilistic Geometry)

###  Theoretical Foundation

Buffonâ€™s Needle is a classic problem in **geometric probability**. Imagine dropping a needle of length $L$ onto a surface with **parallel horizontal lines** spaced distance $d$ apart ($L \leq d$). The probability that the needle **crosses** a line is:

$$
P = \frac{2L}{d\pi}
$$

Rearranging for Ï€, we estimate it as:

$$
\pi \approx \frac{2L \cdot n}{d \cdot h}
$$

Where:
- $n$ is the total number of needle drops
- $h$ is the number of times the needle crosses a line

###  Simulation Process

1. Define $L$ (needle length) and $d$ (distance between lines).
2. Simulate $n$ needle drops:
   - Random center position on the vertical axis.
   - Random angle $\theta$ between $0$ and $\pi$.
3. Determine if the needle crosses a line using trigonometric conditions.
4. Estimate Ï€ using the observed proportion of crossings.

###  Visualization

- The parallel lines are shown as equally spaced horizontal lines.
- Each needle is drawn:
  - **Red** if it crosses a line.
  - **Blue** if it does not.
- This creates an engaging geometric probability visualization.

###  Analysis

- Like the circle-based method, the **accuracy improves** with more trials.
- However, this method **converges slower** and is more **sensitive to geometric constraints**.
- It is particularly useful in demonstrating how **experimental probability** relates to mathematical constants.

##  Monte Carlo Estimation of $\pi$ â€“ Geometric Visualization

![Monte Carlo Ï€ Estimation](/mnt/data/0f5e7bbc-fb1f-4ec0-94f4-88dd30982d7d.png)

###  Description

This plot demonstrates the **Monte Carlo method** to estimate the value of $\pi$ by simulating random points inside a square that bounds a **unit circle**.

- The square spans from $x = -1$ to $1$ and $y = -1$ to $1$.
- A **unit circle** is inscribed in the square (radius = 1).
- **10,000 points** were randomly generated within the square.

###  Color Legend

- **Blue points**: Lie **inside the circle** ($x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$)
- **Red points**: Lie **outside the circle** but still inside the square

###  Ï€ Estimation Formula

The value of $\pi$ is estimated using:

$$
\pi \approx 4 \cdot \left( \frac{\text{points inside circle}}{\text{total points}} \right)
$$

In this plot, the estimate is:

$$
\hat{\pi} \approx 3.13480 \quad \text{(from 10,000 points)}
$$

###  Insights

- The **ratio of blue to total points** approximates the **area of the circle** relative to the square.
- With **more points**, the estimate gets **closer to the true value of Ï€**.
- The plot provides a **visual intuition** for convergence via geometric probability.

This is a foundational example of how randomness and geometry can be used together to estimate fundamental constants like Ï€.

## ðŸ“ˆ Convergence of Monte Carlo Estimation of $\pi$

![Monte Carlo Convergence Plot](/mnt/data/d11b941e-3a92-40a9-8a37-ea7ea75a3f11.png)

###  What This Plot Shows

This graph demonstrates how the Monte Carlo estimate of $\pi$ evolves as the number of randomly sampled points increases.

- The **blue line** represents the **cumulative estimate of $\pi$** after each additional point.
- The **red dashed line** indicates the **true value of $\pi$** (approximately 3.14159).

---

###  Explanation

At each simulation step:
- A point is randomly placed inside the square $[-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]$
- We check whether it lies inside the unit circle: $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$
- We update the estimate of $\pi$ using:
  $$
  \pi \approx 4 \cdot \left( \frac{\text{points inside circle}}{\text{total points}} \right)
  $$

###  Observations

| Range         | Behavior                        |
|---------------|---------------------------------|
| First 100 pts | High variability and oscillation|
| 500+ pts      | Gradual convergence toward $\pi$|
| 5000â€“10000    | Estimate stabilizes near 3.14   |

- The **fluctuations** early in the process are due to small sample size.
- Over time, the **law of large numbers** ensures convergence to the true value.

---

###  Key Takeaway

The Monte Carlo method:
- Converges **slowly but steadily** to an accurate value of $\pi$
- Becomes more reliable with a **larger number of trials**
- Demonstrates how **probabilistic techniques** can approximate deterministic values

This plot is a perfect example of a **stochastic simulation** stabilizing around a theoretical constant.
