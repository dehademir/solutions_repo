# Problem 1

# **Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection*


## **1. Theoretical Foundation**
The horizontal range $R$ of a projectile is given by:

$$
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$

where:
- $v_0$ = initial velocity
- $\theta$ = launch angle
- $g$ = gravitational acceleration

The maximum range occurs at $\theta = 45^\circ$.

## **2. Range Analysis**
- The range is **maximized at 45Â°**.
- **Higher initial velocity ($v_0$)** increases the range.
- **Stronger gravity ($g$)** decreases the range.

---

## **3. Practical Applications**
- **Sports**: Finding the best angle for kicking a soccer ball.
- **Engineering**: Designing projectile launch systems.
- **Space Science**: Understanding rocket trajectories.

## **4. Python Simulation**
This Python code plots the range vs. launch angle:
